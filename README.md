# Animals Image Classifier
This repository contains the code and files for an animal image classification project using TensorFlow.

### Project Overview
In this project, a convolutional neural network (CNN) was used to classify images of animals into one of ten categories: Butterfly, Cat, Chicken, Cow, Dog, Elephant, Horse, Sheep, and more. The model was built using the EfficientNetB0 architecture, a pretrained model available in TensorFlow.

### Key Features:
Model: EfficientNetB0, a highly efficient CNN architecture.
Accuracy: The model achieves approximately 80% accuracy in classifying animal images across the ten classes.
This project is a part of the Animal Image Classification with TensorFlow workshop and showcases the practical application of deep learning for image classification tasks.
